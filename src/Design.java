	 * Design Connection Pool.
	 * 
	 * Use case:
	 * A Consumer can request for a connection and release back the connection.
	 *
	 * Followup :
	 * How would we handle if all the connection are used and consumers are requesting for a connection?

	 * Design a video upload system for a user with low network bandwidth. User looses internet connection after 50% upload.
	 *
	 * User has to upload video which is more than 1GB. Users network bandwidth is too low. Network get dropped after 50% upload.
	 * User tries again and same thing happens. Now to design an optimized efficient solution to address this issue.

	 * Parking Lot Design Using OO Design
	 *
	 * Ways to approach a general Design problem.
	 *
	 * 		Use Cases Generation: Gather all the possible use cases
	 *
	 * 		Constraints and Analysis: How many users, how much data etc.
	 *
	 * 		Basic Design: Most basic design. Few users case.
	 *
	 * 		Bottlenecks: Find the bottlenecks and solve them.
	 *
	 * 		Scalability: A large number of users. 4 and 5 step will go in loop till we get a satisfactory answer
	 *
	 * 		Current Scenario
	 *
	 * Use cases for this problem.
	 * 		Parking can be single-level or multilevel.
	 * 		Types of vehicles that can be parked, separate spaces for each type of vehicle.
	 * 		Entry and exit points.
	 * 		Constraints
	 * 		Number of vehicles that can be accommodated of any type.
	 * 		Basic Design/High-Level Components
	 * 		Vehicle/Type of vehicle.
	 * 		Entry and Exit points.
	 * 		Different spots for vehicles.
	 * 		Bottlenecks
	 * 		Capacity breach for any type of vehicle.
	 * 		Scalability
	 * 		Scalable from single-level to multi-level
	 * 		Scalable from Bike only parking to accommodate all kinds of vehicles.
	 * 		Keeping these in minds, APIs can be designed in the language of your preference.
